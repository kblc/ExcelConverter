# libwebp wrapper for .NET 2.0 and higher

Build status for branch 'master': ![build status](http://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/imazen/libwebp-net.svg)
Last nuget release: ![Nuget release version](http://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Imazen.WebP.svg)



This library is available on Nuget as [Imazen.WebP](http://nuget.org/packages/Imazen.WebP).

This wrapper was created due to Noesis Innovation's abandonment of http://webp.codeplex.com/

Our goals are also a bit more ambitious:

1. Offer low-level P/Invoke exposure for the full libwebp API (complete, partially tested).
2. Be binary compatible with as-is NMake builds of libwebp (no custom C/C++) (complete).
3. Offer a simple encode/decode API (complete).
4. Offer a more detailed encode/decode API for more complex use cases (not yet completed).
